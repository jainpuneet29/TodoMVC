Introduction
This project aims to ensure the reliability and usability of the to-do functionality on the website. Tests are designed to validate core features such as adding, editing, deleting, and viewing tasks, as well as handling edge cases and invalid inputs.

What is Being Tested

Positive Test Cases:
Add a Task: Verify that a user can successfully add a new task.
Edit a Task: Ensure that a user can edit an existing task and save changes.
Delete a Task: Confirm that a user can delete a task.
Mark Task as Completed: Check that a user can mark a task as completed.
Add multiple tasks: Check that user is able to add multiple tasks

Negative Test Cases:
Add Empty Task: Attempt to add a task with an empty description.
Clear Task: Try clearing the task when it is not completed.
Active filter: Verify that Completed tasks are not displayed in Active filter
Completed filter: Verify that Not Completed tasks are not displayed in Completed filter

Test Pattern Used
Page Object Model (POM)
Why POM: POM promotes maintainable, reusable, and scalable test code by abstracting the UI interactions into separate objects.

Structure: Each page of the application has its own page class, encapsulating the elements and actions.

Test Case Organization
Tests are organized into the following structure using TypeScript:

src/
  ├── pages/
  │   ├── BasePage.ts
  │   ├── TodoPage.ts
  ├── tests/
  │   ├── positiveTests.spec.ts
  │   ├── negativeTests.spec.ts
  ├── utils/
  │   ├── testConfig.ts
  ├── playwright.config.ts
  └── package.json

Running Tests:

Prerequisites
-Node.js
-Playwright

Steps
1. Install Dependencies:
- npm install

2. Run Tests:
npx playwright test

Reporting and Analysis
Test Reports:
Playwright Reports: By default, Playwright generates a test report that can be accessed via the playwright-report directory. To view the report:
npx playwright show-report

Important Considerations
Data Privacy: Ensure test data complies with data privacy laws and regulations.

Environment Configuration: Configure environments (staging, production) appropriately to avoid interference and ensure consistent test results.

Regular Updates: Keep test cases and data updated to reflect changes in the application.
